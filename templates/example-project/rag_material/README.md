# RAG Materials

This folder is for organizing project context materials that help you and AI assistants understand your curriculum project.

## How to Use

Add documents that provide background and context for your project:

- Project requirements and constraints
- Research and analysis documents  
- Reference materials and style guides
- Stakeholder information and personas
- Technical specifications and standards

## Organization

Organize however makes sense for your project. Some common approaches:

- By document type (requirements/, research/, references/)
- By project phase (planning/, development/, review/)
- By stakeholder (sme-materials/, learner-research/, technical-specs/)
- All in one folder (whatever works for you)

## AI Context

Files in this folder help AI assistants maintain awareness of your project context across development sessions. Keep materials in text-based formats when possible (Markdown, TXT, PDF, CSV, JSON, YAML).
