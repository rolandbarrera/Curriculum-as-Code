# Advanced RAG Materials

This folder provides enhanced organization for complex curriculum projects with comprehensive context materials.

## Advanced Organization Structure

For complex enterprise-level projects, consider organizing materials by category:

### analysis-research/
- Job task analysis (JTA) documents
- Learner persona research and demographics
- Industry trend analysis and skill gap studies
- Performance gap analysis and learning needs assessment

### requirements-constraints/
- Detailed project specifications and success criteria
- Budget, timeline, and resource allocation documents
- Compliance requirements (WCAG, SCORM, organizational standards)
- Technical constraints and platform limitations

### reference-materials/
- Organizational learning standards and style guides
- Content templates and brand guidelines
- Best practice documentation and case studies
- External reference materials and research sources

### stakeholder-context/
- SME interview notes and technical requirements
- Stakeholder feedback and approval criteria
- Organizational culture and learning environment context
- Change management and implementation considerations

### technical-specs/
- LMS technical requirements and integration specifications
- Accessibility guidelines and testing protocols
- Assessment framework and evaluation criteria
- Analytics requirements and reporting specifications

## Usage for Complex Projects

**Enterprise Training Programs:** Use all categories for comprehensive context management
**Multi-Stakeholder Projects:** Focus on stakeholder-context/ and requirements-constraints/
**Technical Training:** Emphasize technical-specs/ and reference-materials/
**Compliance Training:** Prioritize requirements-constraints/ and technical-specs/

## AI Integration

Reference specific folders in your prompts for targeted assistance:
```
"Based on the stakeholder requirements in rag-materials/stakeholder-context/, please create..."
"Using the technical specifications in rag-materials/technical-specs/, design..."
"Considering the constraints outlined in rag-materials/requirements-constraints/, develop..."
```

## File Format Recommendations

- **Primary:** Markdown (.md) for maximum AI compatibility
- **Secondary:** Plain text (.txt), CSV (.csv), JSON (.json), YAML (.yml)
- **Documents:** PDF for existing materials (AI can extract text)
- **Avoid:** Image-only files, proprietary formats without text extraction

Keep materials text-based when possible for optimal AI assistant consumption and context awareness.
