# Creating Specialized AI Agents for Instructional Design

This guide explains how to create specialized AI agents that assist with specific Instructional Design tasks using either Cline or Roo AI assistants.

## What Are Specialized Agents?

Specialized agents are AI assistants configured with specific expertise, workflows, and context for particular instructional design tasks. They help automate routine work, ensure consistency, and provide expert guidance for complex ID activities.

## Creating Agents with Cline

Cline uses project specific rules and memory banks to create specialized behaviors.

### Agent Creation Process

Reference: [Cline Memory Bank Project Specific Rules](https://docs.cline.bot/prompting/cline-memory-bank#for-clinerules-project-specific)

1. **Create Agent Rule Files**
   
   Create separate rule files for each agent in `.cline/agents/`:
   ```
   .cline/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ curriculum-outline-generator.md
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content-reviewer.md
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assessment-creator.md
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ accessibility-checker.md
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rules.md
   ```

2. **Configure Agent Specific Rules**
   
   Update `.cline/rules.md` to reference agents:
   ```markdown
   # Cline Rules for Curriculum as Code
   
   ## Agent Selection
   When working on specific tasks, reference the appropriate agent rules:
   - Curriculum planning: Use agents/curriculum-outline-generator.md
   - Content review: Use agents/content-reviewer.md
   - Assessment creation: Use agents/assessment-creator.md
   - Accessibility validation: Use agents/accessibility-checker.md
   
   ## Agent Activation
   To activate an agent, ask Cline to "Act as [Agent Name] and [specific task]"
   Example: "Act as Curriculum Outline Generator and help me structure a 5 day leadership course"
   ```

## Contributing New Agents

Help expand the agent library by:

1. **Identifying Common ID Tasks** that could benefit from AI assistance
2. **Creating Agent Specifications** following the templates above
3. **Testing Agent Effectiveness** with real curriculum projects
4. **Sharing Successful Configurations** with the community

**Remember**: Agents are tools to enhance instructional design expertise, not replace professional judgment. Always review and validate agent outputs against your instructional design standards and learner needs.
