# How to Set Up a Curriculum as Code Environment

This guide will walk you through setting up your development environment to use the "Curriculum as Code" methodology with VSCode and AI assistants.

## Step 1: Install VSCode

1. **Download VSCode**
   - Visit [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - Download the version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
   - Install following the standard installation process

2. **Install Optional Extensions**
   
   After VSCode is installed, add these optional extensions for curriculum development:

   - **Markdown All in One** (`yzhang.markdown-all-in-one`)
     Enhanced Markdown editing with preview, table of contents, and formatting
   - **YAML** (`redhat.vscode-yaml`)
     Syntax highlighting and validation for YAML metadata files
   - **markdownlint** (`DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint`)
     Markdown linting to maintain consistent formatting
   - **Spell Right** (`ban.spellright`)
     Spell checking for content creation
   - **GitLens** (`eamodio.gitlens`)
     Enhanced Git capabilities for version control visualization

3. **Install Optional Extensions via Command Line**
   ```bash
   # Run these commands in VSCode terminal
   code --install-extension yzhang.markdown-all-in-one
   code --install-extension redhat.vscode-yaml
   code --install-extension DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint
   code --install-extension ban.spellright
   code --install-extension eamodio.gitlens
   ```

4. **Additional Prerequisites**
   - **Git** For version control
   - **Node.js** (optional) For any automation scripts you might add later

## Step 2: Get API Access to LLM Models

Both Cline and Roo require API access to large language models to function. We recommend **OpenRouter.ai** because it provides access to multiple models from different companies through a single API key.

### Why OpenRouter.ai?

- **Multiple Model Access**: Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, and other leading models in one place
- **Easy Model Switching**: Compare different models for different tasks
- **Simple Setup**: One API key for all models

### Choosing the Right Model

Before selecting a model, research current performance and pricing using these LLM leaderboards:

- **[Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/models)** - Comprehensive model performance and cost analysis
- **[LLM Stats](https://llm-stats.com/)** - Real-time model statistics and comparisons
- **[LMSys Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/)** - Community-driven model rankings based on human preferences

These resources help you choose models that best fit your specific curriculum development tasks and budget requirements.

### Getting Started with OpenRouter

1. **Create an Account**
   - Visit [https://openrouter.ai/](https://openrouter.ai/)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Verify your email address

2. **Add Credits**
   - Go to the Credits section in your dashboard
   - Add funds to your account (start with $10-20 for testing)
   - OpenRouter uses pay-per-use pricing

3. **Get Your API Key**
   - Navigate to the API Keys section
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy and securely store your API key (you'll need it for setup)

4. **Choose Your Models**
   - Browse available models in the Models section
   - Use the leaderboard resources above to select models that fit your needs and budget

### Alternative Options

If you prefer direct access:
- **Anthropic Claude**: [https://console.anthropic.com/](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- **OpenAI GPT**: [https://platform.openai.com/](https://platform.openai.com/)
- **Google Gemini**: [https://ai.google.dev/](https://ai.google.dev/)

### Security Best Practices

- **Never share your API keys** in code repositories or documentation
- **Use environment variables** to store API keys securely
- **Monitor usage** regularly to avoid unexpected charges
- **Set spending limits** in your account dashboard

## Step 3: Choose Your AI Assistant

You have two options for AI powered curriculum development assistance:

### Option A: Cline (Basic AI Assistant)
**Best for**: Instructional designers new to coding workflows, simpler projects
**Features**: Project specific rules, memory bank integration, straightforward setup

### Option B: Roo (Advanced AI Assistant)  
**Best for**: Experienced users, complex projects, advanced workflows
**Key Feature**: Multiple specialized modes including Architect, Code, Ask, Debug, and custom modes for different types of work

```

To use these modes, download the individual YAML files from the [`examples/`](../examples/) folder and import them using Roo's custom mode import functionality. Each mode can be imported individually based on your specific needs.

### Initialize Your Roo Project

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rolandbarrera/curriculum-as-code.git
   cd curriculum-as-code
   ```

2. **Test Roo Integration**
   Start Roo in Curriculum Designer Mode:
   ```
   @mode curriculum-designer
   "Review my Memory Bank and help me design the course outline"
   ```

## Common Workflows

### Creating New Content

1. **Select Appropriate Template**
   - Browse `templates/` folder
   - Choose based on delivery method (eLearning, ILT, VILT, Lab)

2. **Copy and Customize**
   ```bash
   cp -r templates/elearning-module/ my-new-course/
   cd my-new-course/
   ```

3. **Update Metadata**
   - Edit `metadata/course-info.yml`
   - Customize learning objectives
   - Set target audience information

4. **Create Content**
   - Use Markdown for all text content
   - Store media in `assets/` folder
   - Reference templates for consistency

### Version Control Best Practices

1. **Commit Structure**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add lesson 3 - advanced concepts"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Branching Strategy**
   - `main` - stable, reviewed content
   - `develop` - work in progress
   - `feature/lesson-name` - individual lessons

3. **Review Process**
   - Create pull requests for content review
   - Use AI assistants for preliminary quality checks
   - Have subject matter experts review before merging

### Collaboration Guidelines

1. **Team Setup**
   - Each team member follows the same setup process
   - Share Memory Bank configurations across team
   - Establish consistent naming conventions

2. **Content Standards**
   - Use shared templates and style guides
   - Regular team reviews of Memory Bank settings
   - Document decisions in `decisionLog.md` (Roo) or `.cline/rules.md` (Cline)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AI Assistant Not Recognizing Context**
   - Verify Memory Bank files are properly configured
   - Check file permissions in `.cline/` or `memory-bank/` directories
   - Restart VSCode and reinitialize AI assistant

2. **Markdown Formatting Issues**
   - Install recommended VSCode extensions
   - Use markdownlint to identify formatting problems
   - Reference template files for proper structure

3. **Git Conflicts**
   - Use clear commit messages
   - Coordinate with team on file editing
   - Resolve conflicts in content files carefully
