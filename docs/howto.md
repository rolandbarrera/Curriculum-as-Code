# How to Set Up a Curriculum as Code Environment

This guide will walk you through setting up your development environment to use the "Curriculum as Code" methodology with VSCode and AI assistants.

## Step 1: Install VSCode

1. **Download VSCode**
   - Visit [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - Download the version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
   - Install following the standard installation process

2. **Additional Prerequisites**
   - **Git** For version control
   - **Node.js** (optional) For any automation scripts you might add later

## Step 2: Get API Access to LLM Models

Both Cline and Roo require API access to large language models to function. We recommend **OpenRouter.ai** because it provides access to multiple models from different companies through a single API key.

### Why OpenRouter.ai?

- **Multiple Model Access**: Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, and other leading models in one place
- **Easy Model Switching**: Compare different models for different tasks
- **Simple Setup**: One API key for all models

### Choosing the Right Model

Before selecting a model, research current performance and pricing using these LLM leaderboards:

- **[Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/models)** - Comprehensive model performance and cost analysis
- **[LLM Stats](https://llm-stats.com/)** - Real-time model statistics and comparisons
- **[LMSys Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/)** - Community-driven model rankings based on human preferences

These resources help you choose models that best fit your specific curriculum development tasks and budget requirements.

### Getting Started with OpenRouter

1. **Create an Account**
   - Visit [https://openrouter.ai/](https://openrouter.ai/)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Verify your email address

2. **Add Credits**
   - Go to the Credits section in your dashboard
   - Add funds to your account (start with $10-20 for testing)
   - OpenRouter uses pay-per-use pricing

3. **Get Your API Key**
   - Navigate to the API Keys section
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy and securely store your API key (you'll need it for setup)

4. **Choose Your Models**
   - Browse available models in the Models section
   - Use the leaderboard resources above to select models that fit your needs and budget

### Alternative Options

If you prefer direct access:
- **Anthropic Claude**: [https://console.anthropic.com/](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- **OpenAI GPT**: [https://platform.openai.com/](https://platform.openai.com/)
- **Google Gemini**: [https://ai.google.dev/](https://ai.google.dev/)

### Security Best Practices

- **Never share your API keys** in code repositories or documentation
- **Use environment variables** to store API keys securely
- **Monitor usage** regularly to avoid unexpected charges
- **Set spending limits** in your account dashboard

## Step 3: Choose Your AI Assistant

You have two options for AI powered curriculum development assistance:

### Option A: Cline (Basic AI Assistant)
**Best for**: Instructional designers new to coding workflows, simpler projects
**Features**: Project specific rules, memory bank integration, straightforward setup

### Option B: Roo (Advanced AI Assistant)

### Example Custom Modes for Curriculum Development

We've created a comprehensive set of specialized custom modes for curriculum development. Each mode is available as an individual YAML file in our examples folder for easy import:

**[View Examples Folder](../examples/)**

Our collection includes 15 specialized modes organized into two categories:

#### Core Curriculum Development Modes

1. **Instructional Designer**: For creating structured, accessible curriculum content with proper learning objectives and organization
2. **Content Reviewer**: For quality assurance and improvement of existing curriculum materials
3. **Assessment Designer**: For creating effective assessments that accurately measure learning outcomes
4. **Editor**: For ensuring flawless English language usage, grammatical accuracy, and active voice in all curriculum content

#### Instructional Design Model Specialists

These modes are specialized for specific instructional design methodologies:

5. **ADDIE Model Instructional Designer**: Systematic curriculum development through Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation phases
6. **SAM Model Instructional Designer**: Agile, iterative development with rapid prototyping and frequent feedback cycles
7. **Dick and Carey Model Instructional Designer**: Systems approach with detailed goal analysis and precise instructional strategies
8. **Merrill's First Principles Instructional Designer**: Problem-centered learning with authentic, real-world applications
9. **Gagn√©'s Nine Events Instructional Designer**: Systematic lesson design optimizing cognitive processing and retention
10. **Bloom's Taxonomy Instructional Designer**: Cognitive skill development across remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating

#### Using These Modes

To switch to any of these specialized modes in Roo:

```
@mode instructional-designer-addie    # For ADDIE methodology
@mode instructional-designer-sam      # For SAM methodology
@mode instructional-designer-merrill  # For Merrill's First Principles
@mode assessment-designer            # For assessment creation
@mode content-reviewer              # For quality assurance
```

To use these modes, download the individual YAML files from the [`examples/`](../examples/) folder and import them using Roo's custom mode import functionality. Each mode can be imported individually based on your specific needs.

Note: When adding a new mode it is suggested to append the [Code Memory bank module] (https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank/blob/main/modules/memory_bank_strategy_code.yml) to each modes "Mode-specific Custom Instructions" section. This should keep the memory bank working for each custom ID mode added.

### Initialize Your Roo Project

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rolandbarrera/curriculum-as-code.git
   cd curriculum-as-code
   ```

2. **Test Roo Integration**
   Start Roo in Instructional Designer Mode:
   ```
   @mode instructional-designer
   "Review my Memory Bank and help me design the course outline"
   ```

---

## Step 4: Create Your Project Workspace

Before starting any workflow, create a dedicated workspace for your curriculum project:

```bash
# Create a dedicated folder for your curriculum project
mkdir my-curriculum-project
cd my-curriculum-project

# Open as VSCode workspace
code .
```

*This keeps your project separate and organized, making it easy to manage and share.*

### Get Reference Materials (One-time setup)

**Get the Curriculum as Code templates and documentation:**

**Option A: Download (No Git Required)**
- Visit [repository releases](https://github.com/rolandbarrera/curriculum-as-code/releases)
- Download latest zip file
- Extract to your preferred location (e.g., `~/Documents/curriculum-as-code/`)

**Option B: Clone with Git**
```bash
# Clone to a separate location (NOT inside your project)
cd ~/Documents        # macOS/Linux
cd C:\Users\YourName   # Windows
git clone https://github.com/rolandbarrera/curriculum-as-code.git
```

*Keep this separate from your project workspace. This is your reference library.*
