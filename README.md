## The Transformation

Using software development tools and AI, you treat curriculum development like a software project. You manage your curriculum as code, turning common Instructional Design models into a software development process for your content.

This methodology dramatically accelerates content production. You are now enabled to employ multiple focused AI agents to work together on building content, streamlining the ID process and sparking creativity. Git style version control tracks every change like a codebase, keeping your projects structured and iterable.

Automation handles repetitive tasks. And the game changer: you keep AI contextually aware across multiple long sessions, ensuring it stays on track from day to day.

This method transforms content creation and pushes the boundaries of what instructional design can accomplish with a software-based mindset.



## Understanding Context: The Whiteboard Analogy

When using any AI tool, you are filling up a context window. Think of the context window like a whiteboard. The more information you write on the board, the more confused your AI tool becomes about the big picture.

AI models process information in units called "tokens" - roughly equivalent to words or word fragments. Each model has a maximum token limit for its context window (typically 8K to 200K+ tokens).

As you approach this limit, the AI's performance degrades. More critically, using your entire token budget leaves no room for the AI to generate thoughtful responses. This is where AI hallucinations happen most often.

It's like filling your whiteboard so completely that there's no space left to work out solutions. Best practice is to use only 60-80% of available tokens for input, reserving the remainder for high-quality AI output.

Eventually, you have to erase the board by starting a new session and beginning fresh, but now you've lost all your context.


### The Solution

Context engineering solves this problem. It enables you to capture and compress the important context so it's easily accessible by the AI when needed at a later time.

The tools manage that context window effectively, so you can focus on your tasks without having to shift gears back and forth between different activities.

Instead of losing everything when you start over, your AI maintains awareness of what matters most for your project.



## Context Engineering: The Foundation

### What is Context Engineering?

> "Context engineering is the discipline of building dynamic systems that supply an LLM with everything it needs to accomplish a task. To understand this, it's essential to realize that an LLM's 'prompt' is not just a single string of text, but an entire context window of input the model sees before producing output. This context includes multiple components beyond the immediate user question."

> "Context engineering is building dynamic systems to provide the right information and tools in the right format such that the LLM can plausibly accomplish the task."
>

### Context Engineering in Curriculum Development

In curriculum development, context engineering transforms how AI assistants understand and contribute to your instructional design process.

Instead of starting from scratch each session, your AI partners maintain deep awareness of your project goals, content standards, learner profiles, and design decisions across extended development cycles.

This creates a persistent, intelligent workspace where AI becomes a true collaborator in building learning experiences.


## What is Curriculum as Code?

Curriculum as Code applies context engineering and software development best practices to instructional design.


### Core Capabilities

- **Version Control**: Track every change to your curriculum like a codebase

- **Human in the Loop Collaboration**: Enables multiple instructional designers working together seamlessly with AI assistants, maintaining human oversight and review at critical decision points to ensure quality, accuracy, and pedagogical soundness

â€” [How To Use Git to Collaborate with Others [Git Tutorial]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygqx50-JHEE)

- **Modular Design**: Reusable content blocks and standardized templates

- **AI Assisted Development**: Leverage Cline or Roo AI assistants for enhanced productivity while preserving human expertise and judgment

- **Documentation Driven**: Clear, readable Markdown format for all content



## Human in the Loop: The Essential Partnership

Curriculum as Code doesn't remove humans from the development processâ€”it empowers more meaningful human participation.

Traditional curriculum development often forces one person to wear multiple hats, juggling content creation, review, quality assurance, and project management. This methodology opens up the entire development process, allowing teams to add Human in the Loop gates wherever they add value.


### Proven Development Practices

The methodology adopts proven software development practices for curriculum teams:

**Flexible Review Gates**

Add content review checkpoints at any stageâ€”from initial concept to final delivery. Subject matter experts, instructional designers, accessibility specialists, or learners themselves can provide feedback when it matters most.

**Collaborative Workflows**

Multiple team members can contribute simultaneously. Fork projects to explore different approaches, submit changes for review, or collaborate on specific modules without stepping on each other's work.

**Release Management**

Designate release managers who approve curriculum changes before they go live. Establish quality gates, approval workflows, and version control that matches your organization's needs.

**Distributed Expertise**

Leverage specialized roles throughout development. Learning engineers handle technical implementation, SMEs focus on content accuracy, accessibility experts ensure compliance, and instructional designers drive pedagogical strategy.


### Scalable Collaboration

These collaborative processes are optional but available when needed. Teams can adopt as much or as little structure as their projects require, scaling from individual creators to large distributed teams using the same foundational methodology.

The goal is AI-enhanced human collaboration, not AI replacement. Technology handles repetitive tasks while humans focus on creative direction, strategic decisions, and meaningful interactions that improve learning outcomes.


## Quick Start

Transform your curriculum development process in minutes. Choose your path based on your experience level and project needs.

### Step 1: Create Your Project Workspace

**Start by creating a dedicated folder for your curriculum project:**

```bash
# Create a dedicated folder for your curriculum project
mkdir my-curriculum-project
cd my-curriculum-project

# Open as VSCode workspace
code .
```

*This keeps your project separate and organized, making it easy to manage and share.*

#### Before You Start

**Required:**
- âœ… VSCode installed
- âœ… API key ready (OpenRouter, Anthropic, or OpenAI)

**Optional:**
- Git (for version control)
- Node.js (for automation scripts)

### Step 2: Get Reference Materials (One-time setup)

**Get the Curriculum as Code templates and documentation:**

**Option A: Download (No Git Required)**
- Visit [repository releases](https://github.com/rolandbarrera/curriculum-as-code/releases)
- Download latest zip file
- Extract to your preferred location (e.g., `~/Documents/curriculum-as-code/`)

**Option B: Clone with Git**
```bash
# Clone to a separate location (NOT inside your project)
cd ~/Documents        # macOS/Linux
cd C:\Users\YourName   # Windows
git clone https://github.com/rolandbarrera/curriculum-as-code.git
```

*Keep this separate from your project workspace. This is your reference library.*

## RAG Materials: Context for AI Collaboration

### What is RAG

The RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) solves the problem of AI losing context between sessions by creating a persistent knowledge base for your project. Without organized context materials, AI tools cannot access information beyond their training data.

We recommend each new curriculum project includes a `rag-materials/` folder for organizing project context materials that help AI assistants understand your specific requirements and maintain awareness across development sessions. 

### How It Works
When interacting with your AI tool (Cline or ROO) you can ask it to either reference the entire rag-material/ folder or specific files within the folder to help the AI gain context on your topic. The `rag-materials/` folder and its contents become a Knowlege Base repository for your project. We understand that this approach to RAG is simple, yet it is effective. We will implememnt more advanced RAG systems in future iterations. 

**AI Integration:** Reference materials in your prompts:
```
"Based on the requirements in rag-materials/, please create..."
```

```
please ingest templates/pro-mode-project/rag-materials/git.md to assist with the creation of a introductory course outline
```

**Basic Start Projects** Simple RAG structure:
```
my-curriculum-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ rag-materials/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md                  # Simple organization guidance
â”œâ”€â”€ content/                       # Your curriculum content
â””â”€â”€ assets/                        # Your media files
```

**Pro Mode Projects** Enhanced RAG structure:
```
my-advanced-curriculum/
â”œâ”€â”€ rag-materials/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                  # Advanced organization guide
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ analysis-research/         # JTA, learner analysis, performance gaps
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements-constraints/  # Project specs, budgets, compliance
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ reference-materials/       # Standards, templates, style guides
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ stakeholder-context/       # Personas, SME notes, org info
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ technical-specs/           # LMS requirements, accessibility
â”œâ”€â”€ content/                       # Your curriculum content
â””â”€â”€ assets/                        # Your media files
```

### Using RAG Materials

Add documents that provide background and context:
- Project requirements and constraints
- Research and analysis documents
- Reference materials and style guides
- Stakeholder information and personas
- Technical specifications and standards

**Organization:** Structure however makes sense for your project. The README.md provides suggestions, but you decide what works best.

**Best Practices:** Keep materials in text-based formats (Markdown, TXT, PDF, CSV, JSON, YAML) for optimal AI consumption. Hint: Save PPT files to PDF and Publish existing Rise courses to PDF for easy ingestion to RAG system.

### âœ… Verify Your Setup

After each step, check:
- [ ] Project folder created and opened in VSCode
- [ ] Reference materials accessible at your chosen location
- [ ] AI assistant responds to test message
- [ ] Template copying works correctly (Basic Start) or Memory Bank initializes (Pro Mode)

### Common Issues

**"Template not found"**
- Verify reference repository location
- Check folder permissions
- Update template path in AI prompt with your actual location

**"AI assistant not responding"**
- Verify API key configuration
- Check internet connection
- Restart VSCode

## Repository Structure

The Curriculum as Code methodology uses two distinct folder structures:

### Reference Repository Structure
*This is what you get when you download/clone the main repository for reference:*

```
curriculum-as-code/                # Reference repository (~/Documents/)
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                         # Documentation and guides
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/                    # Project starter templates
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ example-project/          # Basic Start template
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pro-mode-project/         # Pro Mode template
â”œâ”€â”€ examples/                     # ID AI modes
â””â”€â”€ README.md                     # This guide
```

### Your Project Workspace Structure
*This is what you create for your actual curriculum project:*

**Basic Start Projects:**
```
my-curriculum-project/            # Your project workspace
â”œâ”€â”€ content/                      # Your curriculum content
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/                       # Your media files
â”œâ”€â”€ rag-materials/                # Project context materials
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md                 # Organization guidance
â”œâ”€â”€ instructions.md               # Project setup guide
â””â”€â”€ (optional) .git/              # Your version control
```

**Pro Mode Projects:**
```
my-advanced-curriculum/           # Your project workspace
â”œâ”€â”€ content/                      # Your curriculum content
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/                       # Your media files
â”œâ”€â”€ rag-materials/                # Enhanced project context
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ analysis-research/        # JTA, learner analysis
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements-constraints/ # Project specs, compliance
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ reference-materials/      # Standards, style guides
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ stakeholder-context/      # Personas, SME notes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ technical-specs/          # LMS, accessibility specs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md                 # Advanced organization guide
â””â”€â”€ (optional) .git/              # Your version control
```

### Key Separation Benefits

- **Clean Independence**: Your project files stay separate from framework files
- **Easy Updates**: Pull latest templates and docs from the reference repository
- **Version Control**: Each project gets its own git history
